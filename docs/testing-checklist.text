This documentation is a living description of what needs to be tested
after Claude (or a human) make a change to the system.


Use these change ranges:

From diff-review: dr -c ba9960b..HEAD
                  This repository

From Linux      : dr -r linux  -c dee4ef0ebe4d^..HEAD
                  git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git

From emacs      : dr -c 4418a37c5df^..cb17a8bbf39
                  git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git

For each of { Linux, MacOS, Windows}:

o Ensure the 'Highlighting' message in the Diff Viewer tab status bar
  is displayed fully when a source file is being re-rendered.

o Ensure {default.json, vim.json} keybindings continue to work.

  Claude has a history of breaking keybindings, and adding new keys on
  its own.

  Use the Shortcuts Dialog (F1) to determine the current keybindings
  to test.  If something doesn't work, it's a defect and a ticket
  should be opened.


o Sidebar

  + Focus must remain on sidebar when no content tabs are open
  + If there is a commit message, it must be first.
  + If there is a review notes file, it must be last.


o Ensure Search functionality works

  + Search works across all open tabs, except Emacs & Vim note editors.

  + These searches must be tested:

     : Search for a regular expression

     : Search for straight text.

     : Search all tabs.

     : Search current tab.

    When these are tested, give examples and expected results.

    The search functionality does not work through Terminal-based
    editors.  This is as-designed.  But, perhaps grep can be used on
    the file, and results shown.  Selection of grep results wouldn't
    go to the right line, but it would be better than flying blind.

  Select elements of search results, and make sure the result is focused.

o MacOS Dark Mode

  TBD

o URL system
  + Http.  Port 80.
  + Https.  Port 443.
  + Keyring.


  TBD


o Emacs & Vim Note Editors

  There has been some difficulty with closing the process, and
  auto-saving the files.

  The file should be written when the tab is closed with Ctrl-W and
  with the close button.

  When the tab is switched away, the file should be saved.  This works
  in both Vim and Emacs by sending keyboard characters to save the
  file.

  When new notes are appended, the file will need to be reloaded when
  the Emacs & Vim tabs are selected.  Perhaps this should be
  automated?

  Most keyboard commands will be sent to the editor, but Ctrl-B,
  Ctrl-\ and F1 are definitely not.  This is as-designed.

Configuring Remote X.
=====================

Basic knowledge of Remote X with SSH is assumed.  Configuring PyQT6 to
work with remote X may need extra packages installed.

When starting vrt, if the following error is generated, then additional packages are required.

>Could not load the Qt platform plugin 'xcb'

The reason is that PyQt needs this library to be able to interact with
the remote X server.

Installation.
=============
On Ubuntu, install the following package after PyQt6 is installed.

$ sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0

# Software Prerequisites

- <code>python3</code>

  An executable named <code>python3</code> must be installed and on ${PATH}.

- <code>pyqt6</code>

This Python module must be installed to be able to generate the
Tcl/Tk-based menu used for viewing the generated diffs:

If this module is not installed, the `view-review` will stop
with an error indicating such.

On Ubuntu, this can be satisfied with:

    sudo apt install python3-pyqt6

# Supported Operating Systems

 - Linux
 - MacOS (basic functionality)
 - Windows (proof-of-concept functionality)

# Viewer Managers

There are two managers that allow viewing of diffs in this package:

1. `view-review-tabs` (`vrt`)

This tool shows a single window, with the list of files contained in
the change -- including the commit message, if one is present -- in
the sidebar.  Clicking on an element in the sidebar loads it into a
tab in the view area.

This tool only provides viewing diffs with the built-in diff engine.
This engine is sufficient, but will be undergoing improvements.

The diff navigation within the tab is identical to `view-review`'s
`Claude-QT` viewer.

2. `view-review` (`vr`)

This tool shows a menu of all the files in the change.  Clicking on an
element in the list will open the base and modified files in a
separate window using the selected diff viewer.

Ultimately, the `Claude-QT` engine will be removed from this diff
manager, as all of its functionality is now subsumed by
`view-review-tabs`.

# Supported Viewers

This system currently supports the following side-by-side diff viewers,
selectable from the <code>Viewer</code> menu.

- Claude-QT (Claude-generated, experimental, pyqt6)
- Emacs
- Meld
- TkDiff
- Vim

If any of Emacs, Meld, TkDiff or Vim cannot be found in commonly-used
install paths for that program, it will not be included in the
<code>Viewer</code> menu.


# Description / Terminology


Change is omnipresent in the software industry.  To help you manage
changes to source, this tool enables viewing of uncommitted and
committed changes in a Git repository.

Before going further, let us take a moment to understand the
terminology used herein to describe the constituent parts of a change.
Each file contained in a change always has two components:


1. **Base file**

    The base file refers to the original file, before modifications
    have been made.  In most cases, the base file comes from the SCM,
    but in some cases, such as an `add`, the base file does not
    exist in the SCM.  When the base file does not exist in the SCM,
    and empty file is used in its stead.


2. **Modified file**

   The modified file, obviously, refers to the after-change file.

   For uncommitted changes, it usually refers to the change-containing
   on-disk file.  But, for modification such as `delete`, an empty
   file will be used.

   For committed changes, the modified file usually comes from the
   SCM, but case where the modified file no longer exists, such as
   `delete`, an empty file will be used in its place.

There are two modes in which this tool can operate: <em>uncommitted
changes</em>, and <em>committed changes</em>.


- **Uncommitted Changes**

  If no revision information (-c) is provided, `diff-review` will
  produce a review for for all `untracked`, `unstaged` and
  `staged` files.

  An uncommitted change includes all modified files, as well as
  `untracked` files, that are in the repository.  By default, they will
  all be included in the generated review, but a command line option
  can disable reviewing of untracked files.

  For purposes of generating viewable diffs, there is no difference
  between `unstaged` and `staged`; the tool uses the current, on-disk,
  uncommitted content.

- **Committed Changes**

  If revision information (-c) is provided, `diff-review` will produce
  a review for all the files changed in the specified revision.

# Usage

1. Clone this repository to any location on the computer.  For
   purposes of this text, we shall assume it has been placed at `~/diff-review`.


2. Load the `aliases` file.

   This alias file is for Bash users.  Those using some other
   incompatible shell will have to provide their own translation.  Any
   submissions will be gladly accepted.

   `source ~/diff-review/scripts.d/aliases`

   This will provide three aliases in your current shell environment:
   `dr`, `vr` and `vrt`.  These directly reference the `diff-review`,
   `view-review`, and `view-review-tabs` programs respectively,
   bypassing the need to update `${PATH}`.

   The examples below will use these aliases.

# Examples

These examples with use `emacs` as the source of changes to review.
Take the time now to go get a basic `emacs` source tree:

    git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git


If you prefer to use the official site, it is here, but it is
extremely slow:


    git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git


## Set aliases in your shell environment

  As shown above in the <em>Usage</em> section, load the aliases into
  your shell.

## View a single committed change

  The following command will generate diffs for a  25-year-old `emacs`
  change.

```
dr -c a3ba27daef3
```

That command will produce the following output on the console:

```
diff-review:  /home/thutt/review/default

  modify   src/ChangeLog
  modify   src/gmalloc.c

Changes:  committed [2 files, 249 lines]
Viewer :  vrt -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Viewer :  vr -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Elapsed:  0:00:00.106696
```

The lines beginning with `Viewer` are commands that can be executed
to view the diffs.

```
vr
```

Pressing `Esc` from both `vrt` and `vr` will  quit.


## Combine and view multiple changes

  The following command will generate diffs for a sequential range of
  emacs commits.

```
dr -c 4418a37c5df^..cb17a8bbf39
```

That command will produce the following output on the console, which
can be directly viewed by executing `vrt` or  `vr`:

```
diff-review:  /home/thutt/review/default

  modify   admin/notes/unicode
  modify   doc/lispref/modes.texi
  modify   doc/lispref/parsing.texi
  modify   doc/lispref/positions.texi
  modify   lisp/comint.el
  modify   lisp/dired-x.el
  modify   lisp/emacs-lisp/easy-mmode.el
  modify   lisp/emacs-lisp/ring.el
  modify   lisp/international/mule-cmds.el
  modify   lisp/international/ucs-normalize.el
  modify   lisp/net/eww.el
  modify   lisp/net/rcirc.el
  modify   lisp/progmodes/gdb-mi.el

  modify   test/lisp/net/tramp-tests.el
  modify   test/lisp/textmodes/ispell-resources/fake-aspell-new.bash
  modify   test/lisp/textmodes/ispell-tests/ispell-aspell-tests.el
  modify   test/lisp/textmodes/ispell-tests/ispell-hunspell-tests.el
  modify   test/lisp/textmodes/ispell-tests/ispell-international-ispell-tests.el
  modify   test/lisp/textmodes/ispell-tests/ispell-tests.el

Changes:  committed [30 files, 378 lines]
Viewer :  vrt -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Viewer :  vr -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Elapsed:  0:00:00.987920
```

## View uncommitted changes

This example will show how untracked, unstaged and staged changes are
processed.

Execute the following:

```
touch untracked;
cat README README >readme;
mv readme README;
git rm config.bat;
```

Now, run `dr`, which will produce the console output:

```
diff-review:  /home/thutt/review/default

   unstaged   README
     delete   config.bat
  untracked   untracked

Changes:  unstaged [1 files, 130 lines]  staged [1 files  384 lines]
Viewer :  vrt -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Viewer :  vr -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Elapsed:  0:00:00.114457
```

As ever, both `vrt` and `vr` can be used to view the changes.

Next, stage the `README` file and re-generate the diffs with `dr`.

```
git add README

```

The console output will appear like this:

```
diff-review:  /home/thutt/review/default

     staged   README
     delete   config.bat
  untracked   untracked

Changes:  unstaged [0 files, 0 lines]  staged [2 files  514 lines]
Viewer :  vrt -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Viewer :  vr -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Elapsed:  0:00:00.114509
```

Finally, make another modification to `README` to show how its state
returns to `unstaged` after executing `dr`.

```
cp BUGS README
```

The console output will look like this:

```
diff-review:  /home/thutt/review/default

   unstaged   README
     delete   config.bat
  untracked   untracked

Changes:  unstaged [1 files, 274 lines]  staged [2 files  514 lines]
Viewer :  vrt -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Viewer :  vr -R /home/thutt/review -r default
Elapsed:  0:00:00.113634
```

## Clean up repository

Now that the examples are finished, you can delete the `emacs` clone.

# Advanced Usage

Invoking either `dr` or `vr` with `--help` will show the current set
options that the program takes.  Using these options will allow more
complex invocations -- such as naming the output, or putting it into a
different directory location.

- Claude-QT (pyqt6)

  This viewer program was entirely generated through conversations
  with Claude.ai.  When it is deemed to be working well-enough, it
  will likely become the default viewer, replacing TkDiff.

  The Help menu describes how to use the features of the program.

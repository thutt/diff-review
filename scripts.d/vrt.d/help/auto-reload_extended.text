This options causes the UI to automatically reload local files, that
are opened in a tab and that have changed on-disk, into the viewer.

Files retrieved via a URL are not subject to automatic reloading.

If you want to reload such a file because the author has updated the
diffs, close the tab and reopen the tab.

Auto reloading is quite useful when you want to &-off the viewer and
iterate on perfecting your own change.

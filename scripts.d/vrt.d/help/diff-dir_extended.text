The --diff-dir provides the location of a diff produced by
'diff-review' which one wants to review.

If not specified, and '--diff-url' is also not specified, the program
will use the default pathname.

When a valid diffs is found at this path, the program will laod the
dossier, and start the UI to view the file diffs.

This is mutually exclusive with '--diff-url'.

The default pathname is '~/review/default'.
